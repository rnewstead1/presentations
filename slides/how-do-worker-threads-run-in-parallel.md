How do Node.js workers run in parallel?


V8 Isolates


A V8 Isolate is an independent instance of chrome V8 runtime


It has its own JavaScript heap and microtask queue


Each Node.js worker can run its JavaScript code completely in isolation from other workers


Workers can't directly access each others heaps


Each worker has its own copy of the libuv event loop.

Note: The copy of the libuv event loops is independent of other workers and the parent workers event loop.
