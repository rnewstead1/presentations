## The beginning


Javascript was a single-threaded language that ran in the browser
     
Note: Javascript was conceived as a single-threaded language that ran in the browser


Single threaded means only one set of instructions is executed at any time in the same process
Note: Being single threaded it means that only one set of instructions is executed at any time in the same process
initially then this was the browser, in modern browsers, this is one thread per tab


Single threaded means a simpler language
Note: This made implementation of the language simpler
And simple for developers using the language
JS was initially only used for adding some basic interaction to web pages, e.g. form validation
Nothing required the complexity of multi-threading
