Why don't we just add threads to JavaScript?

Note: before we talk about worker threads... why don't we just add threads to JS? 
because this would mean we would need to change the nature of the language
and therefore the language itself.
Languages that support multithreading have keywords like 'synchronized' to enable threads to co-operate
